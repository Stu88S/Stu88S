### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior frontend developer who has recently completed "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. I am currently continuing my journey and skills development using other Udemy courses, Codewars and Leetcode.

As a junior developer, I am excited to work on small-scale projects and contribute to larger ones under the guidance of more experienced developers. I am also eager to learn about new technologies and frameworks, such as React or Angular, as well as best practices for writing clean, efficient code.

You can find on my GitHub profile some of the projects I've been working on, including a few personal projects to showcase my skills and an understanding of various web technologies.

I am always open to feedback, so please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or comments.

Thanks for visiting!
