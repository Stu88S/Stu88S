### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior frontend developer who has recently completed several courses on Udemy, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann. Currently continuing my journey and skills development using Udemy, Codewars and Leetcode.
You can find on my GitHub profile some of the projects I've been working on, including a few personal projects to showcase my skills and an understanding of various web technologies.

I am always open to feedback, so please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or comments.

Thanks for visiting!
